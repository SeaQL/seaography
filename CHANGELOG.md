and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## 1.0.3 - Pending

* add `update_mutation`

  This module enables the update mutation for entities. The update mutation takes an entity data object with a filter condition object,
  applies the update to the database and returns the modified entities.


* add `delete_mutation`

  This module enables the delete mutation for entities. The delete mutation takes an entity condition filter object,
  deletes the selected entities from database and returns the number of deleted items.

## 1.0.2 - Pending

* add `create_one_mutation`

  This module is responsible to allow the Create One mutation. The mutation takes data for a single entity and returns the created entity

* add `create_batch_mutation`

  This module is responsible to allow the Create Batch mutation. The mutation takes and array of data for multiple entities and returns the created entities

* refactor entity types

  * add `types_map` This is responsible to allow the API user to provide custom entity field types, parsers and formatters
  * refactor `entity_object` to remove code responsible for type mapping

* simplify schema builder

  * register functions
  * internal context

* extend schema builder entity register function to include mutations

* refactor `filtering` functionality

  * add `FilterConfig` for basic types
  * add `filter_types_map` That is responsible to allow the API user to provide custom entity field filter types and condition functions
  * add `apply_condition` that takes `FilterInputConfig` and `condition` as input and updates the `condition`
  * refactor `active_enum_filter_input` to utilize `FilterConfig` and provide `apply_condition` function
  * remove condition code from `filter_input` and utilize `apply_condition` function that uses `FilterConfig`

* add `entity_input`

  This module is responsible to create a GraphQL input object for an SeaORM entity. Used in the create mutation

* start error handling

=======

## 1.0.0 - 2023-03-25

Introduction the functional API of Seaography. Warning, this version has breaking changes, but it was a sacrifice in order to make the project easier to maintain. With this version we have support for field guards and field renames.

### New Features

* Functional API
* Field renames
* Field guards

### Breaking changes

* Dropped the derive API in favor of a functional API

  SeaORM is a dynamic ORM for rust, this means that we can inspect the Tables, Columns properties on runtime. Recently async-graphql added support for dynamic creation of GraphQL nodes. Utilizing the dynamic nature of both libraries the Derive API is no longer needed and we developed a functional approach API. Moreover, the project in order to live long it needs to be maintainable (easy to maintain) and extensible (easy to extend), but the Derive API was fairly complex compared to a functional API. In order to make the migration easier we updated the seaography generator to generate using the new API

* Decoupled sea-orm-cli from seaography-cli

  Because we don't have to extend the result produced by the sea-orm-cli we decoupled the dependency away fro, seaography in order to make future versions easier to maintain.

* Dataloader optimizations are not introduced yet

  The Dataloader optimizations are going to be added in future versions

* Some renames in Connection node fields, and pagination filtering
